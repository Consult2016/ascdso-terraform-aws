# Aries Systems Consulting - ASCDSO - ascdso-terraform-aws

This repo contains the code *[ascdso-terraform-aws](https://github.com/Consult2016/ascdso-terraform-aws)*,
Master, by [Charles O. Mitchell](https://ariesconsulting.biz).


## Quick start

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each
language, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of
Terraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform).

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the
*[ascdso-terraform-aws](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.


## More examples

The example code in *ascdso-terraform-aws* are mostly for Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is a project underway
to translate these examples to their equivalents on other cloud providers, such as Google Cloud and Azure, here:
https://github.com/mjuenema/Terraform-Up-and-Running-Code-Samples-Translated/.


## Looking for the 1st edition?

All the code examples in the `master` branch are for the 2nd edition of *Terraform: Up & Running*.
